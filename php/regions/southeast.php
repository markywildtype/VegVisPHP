You can stay here in our cosy Woodland Cabin during the winter months or in our bell tents during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Whilst you are here you might like to request a 1:1 Yoga class at an additional cost.</p>
<p>You might also like to hire the whole venue for your specific retreat.</p>
<p>We are located in 3 acres of natural woodland near to the beach, Quarr Abbey, the coastal path, and woodland walks. We are on the main bus route stop linking you to the whole of the Isle of Wight, so we are a perfect base for exploring this wonderful island. We are also a 5 minute walk from the main Isle of Wight Wightlink Ferry linking you to London and afar, so it is really easy to get here too.</p>
<p>We hope that your experiences here will bring you happiness, health, joy and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We are passionate about health and wellbeing and therefore we are a smoke and meat free environment.</p>",
